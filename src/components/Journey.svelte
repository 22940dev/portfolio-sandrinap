    Uff,
    <br />
    you came so far...
    <br />
    and so did Sandrina!
  </h2>
  <p class="text">
    During the last year she have been helping to bring a new (open source) idea to life -
    <a href="TODO">Group Income</a>
    - a decentralized basic income system for small communities. Before that, she was a Senior UI
    Engineer at
    <a href="TODO">Farfetch</a>
    for a few years.
    <br />
    <br />
    Since her early days, back when she was studying Communication Design, Sandrina always looked
    for ways to emerge these two fields: design and development. Her meta-goal is still the same:
    <strong>create human experiences through the digital world.</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    Currently,
    <strong>Sandrina is looking for new opportunities</strong>
    where she can make the difference as a developer who cares not only about the code, but also
    about the people. Remote friendly or somewhere in North Europe.
    <a href="TODO">Get in touch!</a>
