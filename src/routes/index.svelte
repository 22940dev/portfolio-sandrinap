	<p>At the moment she’s open to new projects! One of them is helping to build Group Income, an open source project about Universal Basic Income.

	Before that, she worked at Farfetch, where she learned zillions things about working at big companies.

	Her early days started jumping between startups and freelance projects.

	These are her favorite college projects  made during her degree in Design of Communication.
