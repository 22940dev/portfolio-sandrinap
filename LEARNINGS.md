Here's a list of my learnings while building this website.

## Sapper / Svelte

- Add PostCSS with [svelte-preprocess](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte-preprocess)
- Global.css hot-reload doesn't seem to work on Sapper. (Need ref)
- BUG: Svelte currently [doesn't support passing down CSS classes](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/2870#issuecomment-511251023)
- Svelte converts wild cards to .classes `.container > *` outputs `.container > .child`
- Question: When should export a variable? Docs don't explain it... Edit: export is a variable??
- Use dynamic + static classes: `class="icon {svg}"`
- You don't need to worry about extra updates with useless setState() as in React.
- Create first store! (responsive).
- Question: How to conditionally add attr/events on an element? ??
- Passing props down isn't trivial at all... [Workaround](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/2870#issuecomment-529200474)
- Create a storeFactory to prevent useless updates (storeFactory)
- Functions can be reactive too (as variables!)
- BUG: Svelte removes classes when they are added through `@html` (ex: Values.svelte -> .sBox strong).
- Child components are PureComponents by default!

## Javascript

- Prefer using `window.scrollY` over `document.documentElement.scrollTop` to get [window scroll correctly across all browsers](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20514596/document-documentelement-scrolltop-return-value-differs-in-chrome).

## CSS

- Horizontal content: Use grid as parent and flex as child. it will grow horizontally forever.
- Place multiples texts in the same line without position absolute using -1em.
- TIL: `position:sticky` doesn't work when the parent has `overflow:hidden`

## Accessibility

- `aria-current` to a link to mark it as [the current page link](https://tink.uk/using-the-aria-current-attribute/).
- smooth scrolling when clicking a#tag - we need to handle the focus-changing ourselves because we are override the default scroll behavior.

## VSCode

- Finally did the switch from Atom to VSCode because of lack of Svelte syntax support...
- How to [add multiline tabs to VScode](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57441591/4737729) (can't believe this isn't possible in a easier way)

## Welcome back Sandrina, happy 2020!

Yes, you, miss Sandrina! I hope you come back to this project only in 2020. We both know you needed to rest.
Now with a fresh mind, let's finish this up! Here's a quick recap:

### What's missing:
Well... a bunch of stuff, here and there, but it's okay! I won't list everything because if I did, you would feel overwhelmed and stressed with all of those tiny details missing just to do a "landing page".
So, instead I'll leave you with a couple of starting points. I'm sure you'll remember the rest as you go.

- [x] Start by finish the page navigation - The _About/Journey_ section isn't working correctly on nav click.
- [x] Add the decorative elements to the Intro. Check Figma, they're there.
- [ ] By now I'm sure you'll know what to do next better than I do now. Good luck and welcome back!
