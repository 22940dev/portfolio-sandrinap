Her name is Sandrina Pereira and sheâ€™s a frontend developer.

This is where you can see her personal website code. But... wait, it's still in development! ðŸš§ So, don't be surprised with the amount of `TODO` / `REVIEW` / `OPTMIZE` comments you'll find around. Anyway, here's some info about it:

## Run it locally
```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn # or npm install

# Run in dev mode
yarn start # or npm start
```

## Stack
- **Development**: [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) ([Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/)) + [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)
- **Testing**: [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) & [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- **Deploy**: [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

## What's missing:
Well... let's say we are 70% done.

### UI/UX
- [ ] Finalize animations for Intro (50%)
- [ ] Review "Skills" section overall UX
- [ ] Pick a theme
- [ ] Refine final copywriting
- [ ] Decide footer
- [ ] Decide where to put nav / contacts

### Development
- [ ] Add ReduceMotion option
- [ ] Review test coverage
- [ ] Review Accessibility
- [ ] Easter Eggs!
