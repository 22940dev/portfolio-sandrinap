# Oh, hi there!

Let me introduce myself. I love to help turning ideas into accessible experiences.

My name is Sandrina Pereira and I'm a UX Engineer.

This is where you can see my personal website code. But... wait, it's still in development! üöß So, don't be surprised with the amount of `TODO` / `REVIEW` / `OPTMIZE` comments you'll find around. Anyway, here's some info about it:

## Run it locally
```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn # or npm install

# Run in dev mode
yarn dev # or npm run dev
```

## Stack
- **Development**: [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) ([Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/)) + [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)
- **Testing**: [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) & [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- **Deploy**: [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

## What's missing:
Well... let's say we are 80% done and the other 20% is taking 80% of the time.
