### Oh, hi there!

I'm a UX Engineer who helps to turn ideas into accessible experiences.

This is the source code of my personal website. It was a fun ride that took me around 5 months on and off during my free time. During the journey I took notes of some of my major [Learnings](LEARNINGS.md).

## Run it locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install # or yarn

# Run in dev mode
npm run dev # or yarn dev
```

## Stack
- **Development**: [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) ([Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/)) + [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)
- **Testing**: [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
- **Deploy**: [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)


## Is something missing or wrong?
Feel free to open an issue or let me know my any other medium (e-mail, twitter, etc...). I'd appreciate! ðŸ™Œ
