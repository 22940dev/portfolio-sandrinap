This is where you can see her personal website code. But... wait, it's still in development! ðŸš§ So, don't be surprised with the amount of `TODO` / `REVIEW` / `OPTMIZE` comments you'll find around. Anyway, here's some info about it:

## Run it locally
```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn # or npm install

# Run in dev mode
yarn dev # or npm dev
```
